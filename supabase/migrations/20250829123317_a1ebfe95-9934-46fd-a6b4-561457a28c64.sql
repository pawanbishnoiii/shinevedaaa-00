-- Fix critical RLS policy security issues for sensitive tables

-- 1. Update farmer_network table to protect sensitive farming data
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can register as farmer" ON public.farmer_network;
CREATE POLICY "Users can submit farmer registration"
ON public.farmer_network 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Admin can view farmer network"
ON public.farmer_network 
FOR SELECT 
USING (is_admin());

-- 2. Update inquiries table to protect customer contact information
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create inquiries" ON public.inquiries;
CREATE POLICY "Users can submit inquiries"
ON public.inquiries 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- No SELECT policy for inquiries - only admin can view via existing policy

-- 3. Update story_submissions table to protect farmer contact details  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can submit stories" ON public.story_submissions;
CREATE POLICY "Users can submit stories"
ON public.story_submissions 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- No SELECT policy for story submissions - only admin can view via existing policy

-- 4. Add missing images to crop_portfolio table with sample data
UPDATE public.crop_portfolio 
SET image_url = CASE 
  WHEN name ILIKE '%onion%' THEN 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518977676601-b53f82aba655?w=800&q=80'
